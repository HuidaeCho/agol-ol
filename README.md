# AGOL-OL: ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Web Map using OpenLayers

I wrote this JavaScript code to display one of my web maps hosted on ArcGIS
Online (AGOL). I did not put much time and effort to polish this code, so it is
just good enough to display [this map]
(http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b528fdc8b48e40ad925225387966f523)
and identify feature attributes.

# Usage

```
createWebMap(mapDivId, itemId, extentLayerName);
```
